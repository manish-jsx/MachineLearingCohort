Let's break down and explain each step of the given code snippet:

1. **Initialize Arrays `xx` and `yy`:**
   ```python
   xx = np.array([-0.51, 51.2])
   yy = np.array([0.33, 51.6])
   ```
   Here, two NumPy arrays, `xx` and `yy`, are defined with two elements each. These arrays represent two sets of data points.

2. **Calculate Means:**
   ```python
   means = [xx.mean(), yy.mean()]
   ```
   This line calculates the mean (average) of the arrays `xx` and `yy`. The mean is calculated by summing the elements of the array and dividing by the number of elements.
   - `xx.mean()` computes the mean of `xx`:
     \[
     \text{mean of } xx = \frac{-0.51 + 51.2}{2} = 25.345
     \]
   - `yy.mean()` computes the mean of `yy`:
     \[
     \text{mean of } yy = \frac{0.33 + 51.6}{2} = 25.965
     \]

3. **Calculate Standard Deviations Divided by 3:**
   ```python
   stds = [xx.std() / 3, yy.std() / 3]
   ```
   This line calculates the standard deviation (a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values) of the arrays `xx` and `yy`, and then divides each by 3.
   - `xx.std()` computes the standard deviation of `xx`. Standard deviation is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{std of } xx = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
     \]
     where \( N \) is the number of elements, \( x_i \) are the elements of the array, and \( \bar{x} \) is the mean of the array.
     For `xx`:
     \[
     \text{mean of } xx = 25.345
     \]
     \[
     \text{std of } xx = \sqrt{\frac{( -0.51 - 25.345)^2 + (51.2 - 25.345)^2}{2}} \approx 25.855
     \]
     Dividing by 3:
     \[
     \text{std of } xx / 3 \approx 8.618
     \]
   - Similarly for `yy`:
     \[
     \text{mean of } yy = 25.965
     \]
     \[
     \text{std of } yy = \sqrt{\frac{(0.33 - 25.965)^2 + (51.6 - 25.965)^2}{2}} \approx 25.635
     \]
     Dividing by 3:
     \[
     \text{std of } yy / 3 \approx 8.545
     \]

4. **Correlation Coefficient:**
   ```python
   corr = 0.8
   ```
   This line defines the correlation coefficient, which measures the linear relationship between two variables. Here, the correlation coefficient is set to 0.8, indicating a strong positive correlation.

5. **Covariance Matrix:**
   ```python
   covs = [[stds[0]**2          , stds[0]*stds[1]*corr], 
           [stds[0]*stds[1]*corr,           stds[1]**2]]
   ```
   This line creates the covariance matrix, which includes the variances (square of the standard deviations) along the diagonal and the covariances (product of the standard deviations and the correlation coefficient) off-diagonal.
   - Variance of `xx`:
     \[
     \text{var of } xx = (8.618)^2 \approx 74.281
     \]
   - Variance of `yy`:
     \[
     \text{var of } yy = (8.545)^2 \approx 73.008
     \]
   - Covariance between `xx` and `yy`:
     \[
     \text{cov}(xx, yy) = 8.618 \times 8.545 \times 0.8 \approx 59.054
     \]
   Therefore, the covariance matrix is:
   \[
   \text{covs} = \begin{bmatrix}
   74.281 & 59.054 \\
   59.054 & 73.008
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

6. **Generate Multivariate Normal Samples:**
   ```python
   m = np.random.multivariate_normal(means, covs, 1000).T
   ```
   This line generates 1000 samples from a multivariate normal distribution with the specified means and covariance matrix, and then transposes the result. The `np.random.multivariate_normal` function generates samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
   - `means` is the vector of means:
     \[
     \text{means} = [25.345, 25.965]
     \]
   - `covs` is the covariance matrix calculated above.
   - `1000` specifies the number of samples.
   - The `.T` at the end transposes the result so that each row represents a variable and each column represents a sample.

In summary, this code defines two data points, calculates their means and standard deviations, sets a correlation between them, constructs a covariance matrix, and then generates 1000 samples from a multivariate normal distribution using these parameters. The resulting samples are stored in the variable `m`, with each row representing a different variable (dimension) and each column representing a sample.
